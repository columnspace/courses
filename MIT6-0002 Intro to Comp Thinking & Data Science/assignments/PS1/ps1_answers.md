1. Greedy algorithm takes 0.02 seconds, while brute force method takes 0.57 seconds on my PC. Greedy algorithm is faster than brute force algorithm, since it searches in a smaller solution space. 
2. Greedy algorithm does not return the optimal solution, because greedy algorithm only search in a subset of solution space, and it does not guarantee an optimal solution exists in the subset, unless a proof can be established.
3. Brute force algorithm returns the optimal solution, because brute force method enumerates the entire solution space, and can guarantee an optimal solution.
